# Individual blog post 3
This past week has been an absolute whirlwind between finishing up DS3000, working on the project, and guest speakers. In addition to all of this, our dialogue had the unique opportunity to visit the beautiful city of Luxembourg for the weekend. During this outing, Dr. Gerber and several of the students (including myself) had an absolutely amazing time playing basketball for hours on end. Additionally, 2 of our classmates celebrated their 21st birthday in style at a delicious pizza restaurant! (Who in the right mind doesn't love melted ice-cream cake??)
