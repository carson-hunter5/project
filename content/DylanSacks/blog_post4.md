# Individual blog post 4
I'd like to start this final blog post by emphasizing just how impactful this final project has been to top off this amazing dialogue experience. There was something unique about the appreciation I gleaned with regards to data science/statistics after spending half my day nesarly everyday learning about data science. Being immersed in such an interactive classroom bred the ideal combination of attitude and confidence to handle my portion of this final project, which was the perfect way to apply everything I've worked on the past few weeks in DS 3000 and solidify that knowledge to an applicable topic that can have a tangible impact.

I thoroughly enjoyed the process of transcribing the skills that I aquired from class to a project of my own choosing. It felt analogous to switching from multiple choice to free response where anything was possible as oppsoed to simply answering the questions from classwork and homework. I would be lying to say I was never hesitant about how I would fare being the only DS 3000 student in my group. This brief lack in self-confidence was shrot lived, however. Once I got on a roll and saw my own successes I began to relax and focus more on what I was doing rather than how well I was doing it. 

I handled beginning this project with the data visualizations of the datasets that we found as a group surrounding immigration statistics. I created several different graphs and tables to inspect possible applications that could be gleaned from our manipulated data.

Following these visualizations, I performed linear regression using matrix manipulation based on the mathematical reasoning behind regression to view the relationship between applications and the features previously mentioned.

This model did not look promising. After discussing with Dr. Gerber, we decided to fit an exponential model as opposed to linear, given the appearance of
