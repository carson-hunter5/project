# Individual blog post 2
I managed most of the data science aspects of this phase such as pulling the data from the API's, using pandas to clean them, and investigating possible EDA's to exemplify the main aspects of the datasets and visualize the potential answers to the major questions which inspired this project. I used pandas to download the json files and visualize them as dataframes from their 4 unique url's. I then cleaned the data such as removing rows with empty information. Using these cleaned data, I investigated possible ideas to manipulate them for our project using tools such as .corr() to find values of correlation between different variables.


Using those EDA's, I designed plots that I thought would be useful for interpreting solutions to our questions surrounding immigration and asylum seeking using the datasets and summary statistics, which can be found in the team post for phase 2. Finally, I graphed a regression model of the asylum applications sent to the United States globally per year, which will be used to make predictions about future asylum applications.
