# Individual blog post 1
Although I have thoroughly enjoyed just about every activity we’ve done on the dialogue, the one that stands out the most was the first visit we had to the EEAS in Brussels. During this visit, we had several talented guest speakers discuss what the EEAS is and their personal role in its proper function. During this we discussed the concept of disinformation/misinformation. This has been the most intriguing thing I’ve learned since arriving a week ago because of how prominent it was discussed to be. Although I have certainly heard about fake news being discussed in the realm of politics, as well as deep fakes made by AI, my understanding of the severity of the issue was astonishingly inaccurate. Several of the key points the third speaker emphasized were concepts that I hadn’t even fathomed. It is clearly quite a large and present issue that democratic societies are more vulnerable to the misinformation produced by non-democratic states, due to their lack of information filtration in comparison with states such as Russia or China. One of the statistics he mentioned was that there have been 16,000 known cases of pro-kremlin disinformation catalogued since 2015. We were also taught the distinction between disinformation and misinformation to be dependent on the intentions, where disinformation is objectively false or misleading information spread with the intent of causing harm, whereas the negative impact from misinformation occurs by accident. The message that I personally took away from this speaker was that information integrity and manipulation is an incredibly harmful act that even though in some cases may not be illegal, it is almost a proxy war. To conclude, I was absolutely blown away by the necessary amount of time and effort that goes into fighting this spread of false information, as well as how impactful it can be. I think this is such an important topic that people need to be further educated on in order to be critical thinkers and make better decisions.

I managed most of the data science aspects of this phase such as pulling the data from the API's, using pandas to clean them, and investigating possible EDA's to exemplify the main aspects of the datasets and visualize the potential answers to the major questions which inspired this project. I used pandas to download the json files and visualize them as dataframes from their 4 unique url's. I then cleaned the data such as removing rows with empty information. Using these cleaned data, I investigated possible ideas to manipulate them for our project using tools such as .corr() to find values of correlation between different variables.


Using those EDA's, I designed plots that I thought would be useful for interpreting solutions to our questions surrounding immigration and asylum seeking using the datasets and summary statistics, which can be found in the team post for phase 2. Finally, I graphed a regression model of the asylum applications sent to the United States globally per year, which will be used to make predictions about future asylum applications.
