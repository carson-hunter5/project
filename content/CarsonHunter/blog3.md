Hey Blog! 

I can't believe we're almost done with the dialouge. I've had such a fun time in Belguim and every day I'm consistently surprised by how much I've enjoyed this trip. I will admit, however, there are some creature comforts of home I'm starting to miss.

 #1 AIR CONDITIONING! I am a person who loves to be cold when I'm indoors, and the lack of air conditioning (or ventalation in general) is a real point of contention for me. 

 #2 ICE! I am going to begin to refer to Europe as the continent of room temperature everything. I cannot wait to drink gallons and gallons of ice water when I get back to the States. 

 #3 WATER!!!!! Extending from my second point, I feel that I'm in a constant state of dehydration here. I miss the abundance of drinking fountains in the state, and the large cups and bottles that I can fill with said fountains. I also miss not paying for water. Sometimes water at restaurants costs more than beer(?!)

That being said, I love so much about this place, but home will always be home! I just wish America adopted the "tax included" standard that exists in Europe. It makes things so much simpler. 

**Project Contributions**

This phase of the project caused many hurdles. Though msot of the major kinks seemed to be ironed out, it definitely required lots of work to get there. In this phase of the project specifically, I worked heavily on writing and calling the api routes that Ivy outlined in the matrix. I worked with Ivy to help set out formatting and initial structure for the front end pages. I also helped Dylan get the machine learning model running.
