## The End of an Era

Hey blog,

 I am unbelievably upset to be writing this less than 24 hours before I leave the dialogue. This has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my life. I am very sad, yet grateful that I enjoyed somewhere so much that it's hard to leave. From all the experiences, memories, and inside jokes, this has been an unforgettable experience. Belgium is amazing (and underrated) and I will always cherish my month in Leuven. 

## The Project

Though intense, this project has been one of the most profound learning experiences I've ever had. I feel immensely more confident as a programmer and am incredibly proud of the work I have done. 

In terms of the work distribution, I largely functioned as a medium for this project. As a data science major, I have an understanding of Python programming that allowed me to work as a bridge between the computer and data science project. While Ivy did much of the front-end work, I handled many of the routes and the implementation of the ML models. I worked heavily on inputting data into the database, acquiring it through calls, and using the information from the database in the models Dylan built. Overall, I feel I was a good intermediary between CS and DS.
