Hi Blog! 

We’re officially halfway through the dialogue and I’m more than sad to say that there’s less time in Belgium in front of me than there is behind. It’s been such a fun experience and every day brings a new and exciting adventure.

With that being said, it's been a busy 2 weeks. We’ve had a variety of experiences, from day trips to other cities, more talks with powerful people, and even pastry workshops!

**(Thanks Dr. Fontenot)**

It’s been a great time, and I keep reiterating how Belgium continues to exceed my expectations. Though I’m sad the end of the trip is approaching, I’m excited to keep having more of these fun experiences!

**Project Contributions**

In this phase of the project, I worked on altering the user stories to match the scope of the project more. Specifically, Ivy and I worked on brainstorming ideas for integrating a more software-based approach instead of purely data science. After generating accurate user stories, Ivy and I collaboratively authored our ER diagrams to depict the relationships. While Ivy dealt more with the local diagrams, we both worked on merging them into one cohesive global diagram. I also handled the participation and cardinality for the relationships. I worked with Ivy to complete SQL DDL as we worked through our global ER diagram. Ivy typed the code while I interpreted the ER diagram. I then worked on the wireframe that Ivy originally created, especially focusing on the refugee portion.
