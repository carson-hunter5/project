# Model 1
Our first model is an exponential regression model which outputs the predicted number of applicants expected to seek asylum given the country of asylum (where they're migrating to) and their age group[(0-4), (5-11), (12-17), (18-59), (60+)]. The overall intention was to create this product to be used by migration officials such as Tanya Brakcer from our initial user archetype to understand and predict the age group demographic immigrating to new countries in order to effectively allocate school budgets.
