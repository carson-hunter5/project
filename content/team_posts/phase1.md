# Introduction

Hi, and welcome to our blog! We hope you all enjoy our documentation of this exciting process and journey during our Dialouge in Leuven, Belguim. Our team consists of three members:

- Carson Hunter
- Ivy Jordan
- Dylan Sacks

Without further ado, here's our project!


# Our Project Description

Migration is a natural byproduct of any human society and thus has remained and will continue to be a highly important topic for governments, politicians, and citizens alike. This often contentious topic can be very polarizing, and thus produces a wide range of emotions when discussed. Using more quantitative approaches to grasp this topic could help to reduce the contention and subjectivity behind migration. Recent years have specifically called to attention the incidence of refugee crises across the globe. As conflicts arise and citizens flee their countries, with often varying motivations, countries must now grapple with managing this influx of refugee populations. To do this, they must be given adequate time to prepare for, and thus react to changes in refugee populations or patterns. This project aims to create a software based tool to visualize and predict refugee and migration patterns. Using various datasets, our group hopes to both report on past immigration patterns and predict future trends using machine learning models. We hope that by providing an easy to use tool, we can allow important stakeholders to have a better understanding of the trends surrounding refugees and immigration. With this greater insight, our hope is that stakeholders will be able to use this quantifiable information to determine the best courses of action, ensuring the safety and wellbeing of both refugees and their populaces alike. This tool could additionally provide evidence based information to a very controversial topic, helping to create adequate justifications for the decisions that these shareholders choose to make. 

## This is a Level 2 heading 

Wait, can you hear me now?
