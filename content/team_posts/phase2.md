# Updates and Changes from Phase I

After our first initial round of feedback, we decided to implement a few changes from the original blogpost. The first change being the user stories to be properly formated: 

As a ____, I want to ___ so that _____ . 

## User Stories and Personas

**Immigration Focused Entities: Jackson Davies is a field officer with USCIS who has experience facing sudden surges in immigration applications, leading to delays and inefficient processing.**

a) As a field officer, I want to allocate resources needed populations within a targeted area of the United states so that I can correlate that certain areas are more subject to more migration than others.

b) As a field officer, I want to efficinetly manage immigration applications and anticipate where an influx of groups may arise so that I can show the correlation during a time of crisis based on historical context. 

c) As a field officer, I want to be able to coordinate with other immigration enities so that policies and regulations on immigration are based on the attributes and qualities of migration from certain countries. 

**Relief Groups: Kyle Medina is a data scientist for the UNHCR based in Geneva, Switzerland, who is tasked with overseeing NGO / Red Cross locations which are facing a shortage of supplies in developing countries in the Southern Hemisphere.**

a) As a data scientist, I want to predict migration patterns to nearby asylum seeking countries, so that we can account for the amount of necessary supplies needed for a duration of time.

b) As a data scientist, I want to know which regions that will be prone to an influx of refugees so that we can anticapte the amount of employees/volunteers needed during a given timeframe.  

c) As a data scientist, I want to enhance the efficiency of distribution flow of certain products needed by a certain group of refugees such as women vs men, and children vs elderly groups.

**Urban Development Planners: Tanya Bracker is a city council member from Utica, New York, a city with a large refugee population, based on the last few years population increase, there will be budget cuts and allocations for more city resources.**

a) As a city council executive, I want to identify the common age demographic levels of refugees so that I know if primary and secondary schools budget allocations will be most effective.

b) As a city council executive, I want to anticipate and manage the housing needs for incoming refugees by predicting which regions are likely to send more refugees so that we can prevent housing shortages.

c) As a city council executive, I want to map refugee settlements and forecast growth within a certain area so that I can plan and improve public transportation routes and schedules.
