# **Brussel's International Presence**

One thing that I've found interesting so far being in Belgium, in general is just the sheer amount of international agencies are based here. On first glance or intial thought I would always imagine these large entinties like NATO, UNICEF, EEAS, etc would be located in France, Netherlands, or even Germany. 

However learning more about the reasoning behind the location, makes sense in terms of the geographical location. It was central to some of the founding organizations for NATO that were already located in Europe such as West Germany, France, Luxembourg, Belgium, and Netherlands.  This as well as during the President Charles de Gaulle withdrew France from NATO because of the organizationâ€™s domination by the United States and the "intrusion" upon French sovereignty.  

With Belgium being home to so many international bodies, and having contact with representatives from over 45 countries, it also adds to the multitude of languages being spoken not ony in the capital of Brussels, but even here in Leuven.
