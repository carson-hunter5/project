There was something unique about the appreciation I gleaned with regards to data science/statistics after spending half my day nesarly everyday learning about data science. Being immersed in such an interactive classroom bred the ideal combination of attitude and confidence to handle my portion of this final project, which was the perfect way to apply everything I\u0026rsquo;ve worked on the past few weeks in DS 3000 and solidify that knowledge to an applicable topic that can have a tangible impact.\nI thoroughly enjoyed the process of transcribing the skills that I aquired from class to a project of my own choosing. It felt analogous to switching from multiple choice to free response where anything was possible as oppsoed to simply answering the questions from classwork and homework. I would be lying to say I was never hesitant about how I would fare being the only DS 3000 student in my group. This brief lack in self-confidence was shrot lived, however. Once I got on a roll and saw my own successes I began to relax and focus more on what I was doing rather than how well I was doing it.\nI handled beginning this project with the data visualizations of the datasets that we found as a group surrounding immigration statistics. I created several different graphs and tables to inspect possible applications that could be gleaned from our manipulated data.\nThis was my favorite part of the project. Using such a large dataset to view different trends felt like there were endless possibilities and applications we could use our data for given all the manipulations and interpretations that could be made from those manipulations. Following these visualizations, I performed linear regression using matrix manipulation based on the mathematical reasoning behind regression to view the relationship between applications and the features previously mentioned.\nThis model did not look promising. After discussing with Dr. Gerber, we decided to fit an exponential model as opposed to linear, given the appearance of the points in the first visualization graph (Asylun appplications to USA). After implementing this model, the predictions were not very accurate. I looked at implementing a box-cox transformation, however after correcting the mistake of adding a 1 to all the values before taking the log by changing it to a 0.001, the Q-Q plot no longer showed as severe of a deviation in the residuals line indicating skewed residual distribution. The most difficult part of this project was dealing with the possible changes to this model. There were about 5 changes made to this model before settling on one that in my opinion could use a lot of work before being as accurate and thus impactful as it could be. Not to say it is not succesful, it is certainly a proof of concept that \u0026lsquo;works\u0026rsquo;, but it shows a lot of promise in an area that needs insurmountable help that could help millions of people. Additionally, the constant changing of the model was time consuming, and frustrating. However, I\u0026rsquo;m glad that it went exactly as it did because it was a learning experience, and simply how model implementation works.\nAfter finishing this model, I used randomforests classifier to make a model predicting country of origin given the year, country of asylum, age group demographic, and number of applications.\nThis model had a lot of promise and would strongly support the user archetypes we created at the beginning of the project. However, this model was ultimately trashed due to low success rate and personal preference for a third model I created using randomforests linear regression to predict the acceptance rate of a country given the year, country of origin, country of asylum, and total applications.\nIn addition to making these models, I performed cross validation to ensure there was minimal over/underfitting I also assisted the database team as best I could to implement the models, working in tandem to create functions that could be called from the user in order to calculate the predictions from the model. I would include this project on my resume in my extracurriculars section (as a non-cs major) by saying:\nDesigned and implemented machine learning models in custom app with ability to predict future migration patterns to help migration officials make efficient and better informed decisions.\nThe project title is \u0026ldquo;SUBLEVA\u0026rdquo;\n","date":"9 June 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/gerber-test-hugo/dylansacks/phase4individualpost/","section":"","summary":"Final Blog Post # I\u0026rsquo;d like to start this final blog post by emphasizing just how impactful this final project has been to top off this amazing dialogue experience.","title":"Individual Blog Post 4","type":"dylansacks"},{"content":"","date":"9 June 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/gerber-test-hugo/authors/ivy_jordan/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Ivy_jordan","type":"authors"},{"content":" Model 1 # We, as a team initiated this project by searching for the most detailed datasets we could find and brainstorm how they could be used. After working together to come up with applications for the extensive UNHCR dataset about immigration, we began with data visualizations to view possible trends as inspiration for our ML model. We viewed the correlates of features included in the dataset such as year, gender, and country of asylum which fit to a linear regression model.\nThis shortly evolved to an exponential regression model due to the seemingly exponential trend over time in some of the data visualizations that were used as a proof of concept for the regression model. The model outputs outputs the predicted number of applicants expected to seek asylum given the country of asylum (where they\u0026rsquo;re migrating to), gender, year and their age group[(0-4), (5-11), (12-17), (18-59), (60+)]. The overall intention was to create this product to be used by migration officials such as Tanya Brakcer from our initial user archetype to better understand and predict the age group demographic immigrating to new countries in order to effectively allocate school budgets.\nAfter the demographics dataset was loaded and cleaned by removing unnecessary or repeated columns, the pandas function df.melt was used to change the dataframe from a long to wide format. This essentially created a row for each instance of the counts in the multiple age group columns, combining those separate columns into one age group column. Each row now had a unique combination of year, country of asylum, age group, gender and number of people who fit that exact demographic. Because we decided this should be an exponential model, the log of that number was taken after adding 0.0001 to include the rows that had a number of 0 given the zeroes (No 0-4 females applied for asylum to Afghanistan in 2010).\nThe pandas function get_dummies() was used to assign the rows dummy variables. This changed countries column to give each unique country a column (increasing the number of columns by about 200). Every country in the row has a 0 other than a 1 for the country that the row is referencing:\nThis was done to use the resulting matrix (that now only had integers but retained all the desired information) could be used to manually train the model. The X-values(predictors) and y(number of applicants) were assigned and a bias column was added to the predictors. The coefficients were then calculated using the normal equation \\( b = (X^T X)^{-1} X^T y \\) , and predications were calculated by multiplying the coefficients matrix by the X matrix, and residuals were calculated by subtracting the difference in predicted versus actual values.\nThe model was firther checked by calculating r2, mse. A Q-Q and residuals vs predicted values was completed to view the model success. Unfortunately, the rows with zeroes greatly affected the model as outliers, and brought the slope down greatly. This can be seen in the following graph by the outlier line below 0:\nThis function was then written to be able to make and call the unique X matrix of 1 and 0 containing information for year, country (array of all zeroes other than a 1 for desired country in the same order as the final dataframe the model was trained on), gender (1 for male, 0 for female), and age (array of zeroes other than the specific age group in the same order model was trained on)to be used for future predicitons. This is called one-hot encoding, and is very common for training ML models: The fucntion can then be used to output the following:\nA bias column was then added to this resulting matrix, accomodating for the y-intercept, of which the dot product with the coefficient matrix was taken. The resulting output was then bakctransformed by applying the exponential function due to the log-transformed data from the beginning of the data manipulation.\nModel 2 # The pipeline leading to the implementation of the second model began similarly to the first by deciding on a linear regression model to predict the acceptance rates for countries of asylum given the year, country of origin, and total applications based on extensive data visualizations that occured after manipulating the dataframes:\nThis was one of the correlation matrices used to come up with some of the idea behind the second model. Cleaning the data and adding a column for acceptance rate by dividing number of acceptances by total applications resulted in the following:\nThe country id\u0026rsquo;s were used instead of country names because the randomforests regression model produced an error when countries were strings. The dataset used had each country both as a string and indexed so making this change was extremely easy, the columns of strings simply were swapped with the column of indexed countries.\nAfter importing randomforests regression libraries, defining the X features as year, country of origin, country of asylum, and total applications, and dependent variable as acceptance rate, the data were split into training and testing sets.\nThe model was then trained and fit by calling the randomforestsregressor() .fit() functions. Predictions were made using the .predict() function. An advantige to this model was that randomforests does not calculate predictions the same way model 1 did manually. Instead of using matrices, it builds many decision trees with slight variations based on the unique subset of data it\u0026rsquo;s trained on. Outputted predictions are then given by taking the average from all the trees from the training data. This has advantages and disadvantages, such as fewer assumptions regarding the data (doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be linear), while also having less troubleshooting capabilities if an output looks incorrect.\nhttps://1drv.ms/p/s!AoI_NaOVP0kei2mD7Rs13rULGXZi\n","date":"9 June 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/gerber-test-hugo/team_posts/phase4post/","section":"Project - Phase I","summary":"Model 1 # We, as a team initiated this project by searching for the most detailed datasets we could find and brainstorm how they could be used.","title":"Project - Phase IV","type":"team_posts"},{"content":"","date":"9 June 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/gerber-test-hugo/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":" Ivy Jordan # Hi, My name is Ivionna Jordan, and I\u0026rsquo;m currently a rising third year studying Computer Science and Design with a minor in Information Design at Northeastern University.\nIf you are interested in learning more about me and my other works, feel free to connect with me on my personal website or via Linkedin:\nhttps://jordan-iv.github.io\n","date":"5 June 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/gerber-test-hugo/ivyjordan/","section":"","summary":"Ivy Jordan # Hi, My name is Ivionna Jordan, and I\u0026rsquo;m currently a rising third year studying Computer Science and Design with a minor in Information Design at Northeastern University.","title":"","type":"ivyjordan"},{"content":" Individual blog post 3 # This past week has been an absolute whirlwind between finishing up DS3000, working on the project, and guest speakers. In addition to all of this, our dialogue had the unique opportunity to visit the beautiful city of Luxembourg for the weekend. During this outing, Dr. Gerber and several of the students (including myself) had an absolutely amazing time playing basketball for hours on end. Additionally, 2 of our classmates celebrated their 21st birthday in style at a delicious pizza restaurant! (Who in the right mind doesn\u0026rsquo;t love melted ice-cream cake??)\nThis week, I spent a lot of time applying my best efforts to this rapidly evolving project. Because I am the only DS3000 student in my group, I handle most of the data science aspect of this project. For the third phase of this project, it mainly revolved around refining the first ML model for the project.\nAs a group, we decided to take the project in a different direction than the proof of concept ML model last exemplified in phase 2 was headed in. Because of this, Dr. Gerber helped me to go through the data and view certain trends to visualize how the data might be manipulated to help our group create a new model. We ultimately landed on using age/gender demographics after hot encoding the dataframe to include every country in the columns. After this, the linear regression model was modified to exponential regression based on the slope of the line for asylum applications over time. This appeared challenging, although in the end it was only one or two extra lines of code. I finished up my contributions to phase 3 by viewing scatterplots of the residuals to check for homoscedasticity and Q-Q plots for residual distribution. Unfortunately, the results for both of these were ultimately dissapointing, but the r2 of 0.26 and relatively low mse were enough proof of concept to continue.\n","date":"5 June 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/gerber-test-hugo/dylansacks/phase3individualpost/","section":"","summary":"Individual blog post 3 # This past week has been an absolute whirlwind between finishing up DS3000, working on the project, and guest speakers.","title":"Individual Blog Post 3","type":"dylansacks"},{"content":" Data Model Modifications and Updates # The ML model from phase 1 was completely scrapped for a variety of reasons, including a lack of impact the output would have on the user. The new model uses exponential regression (reasoning discussed below) to output the predicted number of immigrants expected to apply for asylum to a given country in a given year. This was used on a different dataset from the same API.\nBelow is the list of tables that we have currently and whether or not this data will be sourced or generated via mockaroo:\nAppointments # Source: Generated via Mockaroo\nDescription: Contains appointment details for users and volunteers.\nAttendeeEvents # Source: Generated via Mockaroo\nDescription: Records of events attended by users and volunteers.\nCommunityEvents # Source: Generated via Mockaroo\nDescription: Information about various community events organized for or involving users and volunteers.\nCountries # Source: Sourced\nDescription: List of countries and their details.\nCountryStats # Source: Sourced\nDescription: Statistical data related to countries, including population and asylum application statistics.\nDependents # Source: Generated via Mockaroo\nDescription: Information about dependents of users\n## Posts # Source: Generated via Mockaroo\nDescription: User-generated posts and related information.\nRefugeeCohort # Source: Sourced\nDescription: Details and statistics about refugee cohorts.\nUsers # Source: Generated via Mockaroo\nDescription: User profiles including personal information and relevant attributes.\nVolunteers # Source: Generated via Mockaroo\nDescription: Profiles of volunteers.\nDataset # This is the dataset used to train the exponential regression model, taken from the same API used in phase 2. This dataset, however, gives information regarding the age and gender demographics of asylum seekers from 2010-2022 as opposed to the varying types of immigration applications used in phase 2. The advantage to this change in dataset was that the user archetypes discussed in phase 2 would likely have greater affinity to the predictive output generated to this dataset. For example, Tanya Bracker could use the information about the demographics surrounding asylum seekers to better allocate funds for schools (just one of many real world examples). Because these data are from a public API, they are sourced, and not generated. This graph depicts the residuals of the exponential regression. There is clearly heteroscedasticity, exemplified by the lack of residuals randomly scattered around zero, an indicator of homoscedasticity. A future improvement for this model which will be investigated shortly is a box-cox transformation. This was ultimately hypothesized as a possible solution for the relatively poor model outcomes after viewing a Q-Q plot to investigate the distribution of residuals. This plot is detailing that the residuals appear to be non-normally distributed. Because this is an indicator of poor model fitting, a box-cox transformation will be performed as an attempt to normalize the distribution of residuals. Features used for ML and reasoning # Country of Asylum (coa): Demographic patterns can differ significantly between countries. Including this variable enables the model to give more accurate information which is subjective to a specific country.\nYear : Demographic patterns can change over time due to factors like economic conditions, political instability, conflicts, and policy changes. The model should capture these temporal changes to make accurate future predictions.\nAge: Age is a critical demographic factor that influences health care needs, educational requirements, and economic participation. Breaking down the population into age groups allows the model to capture differences in demographic profiles and needs across various age brackets.\nGender: Gender is a fundamental demographic factor that can affect migration patterns, health needs, and social vulnerabilities. Including gender allows the model to differentiate demographic patterns between males and females.\nAPI Routes and Explanations # City Council API Routes # GET /city_council Purpose: Retrieve all community events from the database.\nPOST /council_add_event Purpose: Create a new community event.\nPUT /city_council/communityEvent Purpose: Update an existing community event.\nDELETE /city_council/communityEvent/ Purpose: Delete a specific community event based on its event ID.\nGET /city_council Purpose: Retrieve all appointments from the database.\nGET /city_council/ Purpose: Get demographics for a specific cohort of refugees.\nDELETE /city_council/delete_bulletin/\u0026lt;post_id\u0026gt; Purpose: Delete a specific bulletin post based on its post ID.\nGET /city_council/bulletin Purpose: Retrieve all bulletin posts.\nMigrant API Routes # GET /migrant/appointments/ Purpose: Retrieve all appointments from the database for a specific migrant.\nGET /migrant/show_appt/ Purpose: Retrieve a specific appointment based on its appointment ID.\nPOST /migrant Purpose: Create a new appointment for a migrant.\nPUT /migrant/appointment Purpose: Update the appointment details for a specific migrant.\nDELETE /migrant/appointment_delete/ Purpose: Delete a specific appointment based on its appointment ID.\nGET /migrant/posts Purpose: Retrieve all posts from the database.\nGET /migrant/ Purpose: Retrieve a specific migrant\u0026rsquo;s posts based on their migrant ID.\nPOST /migrant/add_post Purpose: Create a new post for a migrant.\nPUT /migrant/post Purpose: Update a specific post for a migrant.\nDELETE /migrant/post/ Purpose: Delete a specific post based on its post ID.\nGET /migrant/events Purpose: Retrieve all community events from the database.\nImmigration Official API Routes # GET /immigration_official/population Purpose: Retrieve the population from the database based on countryID.\nGET /immigration_official/countryStats Purpose: Retrieve all country statistics from the database.\nPOST /immigration_official/newStat Purpose: Create a new country statistic entry.\nPUT /immigration_official/editCountryStat Purpose: Update an existing country statistic.\nDELETE /immigration_official/deleteCountryStat Purpose: Delete a country statistic entry based on countryID.\nGET /immigration_official/numApplications Purpose: Retrieve the number of applications for a specific country in a given year.\nGET /immigration_official/applicationTrends Purpose: Retrieve the overall trend of applications for a specific country in a given year.\nDemonstration of Working Model # Surprises/setbacks # The main difficulty when designing this model was that the linear regression model (to put it bluntly) was terrible.

The largest difference between the two being the demographics between the two countries. In Belgium - or at least in Leuven and Brussels to an extent - there was a large older demographic. Everyone in Luxembourg for the most part were older men and women who seemed to be working in government or retired. I heard from other students that went out that the average age range in the bars and clubs was around mid fourties.\nThe amount of pure luxury that exudeded from the citizens there was palpable. The buses for public transportation were Mercedes, the number of Audis and BMWs were no longer worth counting once I reached 75 in a matter of 36 hours, and there was a Porshe 911 that I saw that I\u0026rsquo;m still waiting on Maggie to send me the photo of so I can make it my wallpaper. In some ways its a less flashier version of Monaco.\nDr.Gerber and a banana in Luxembourg on June 1st, 2024 However, in some ways I understand the lack of younger people in Luxembourg due to two things - cost of living and education.\nAlthough Luxembourg is indeed a very beutiful place filled with different activities such as hiking, biking, shopping, and eating - its EXPENSIVE. Most young professionals probably wouldn\u0026rsquo;t want to stay in Luxembourg unless they were making lots of money that they didn\u0026rsquo;t mind going to takes or they worked in the government (which I unfortunately don\u0026rsquo;t think pays as well as the private sector, which is also another possibility). There was even a noticable difference in the cost of basic necessities here compared to Belgium. A bottle of water here in Belgium from a small shop or even grocery store runs around 1 - 2 euro, compared to Luxembourg the water was 2.50 - 3 euro (not a notciable difference, but did I end up buying any water in Luxembourg- the answer is NO!!)\nAnother thing that may also contribute to the lack of younger professionals and students may be education. In the Luxembourgish education system, students schooling is broken down into three sectors, where they are taught three different languages. Luxembourgish is the standard language taught when students are first beginning to start school, until around the age of 6, where German is first introduced. After 6 years old, students are taught in German, with French being the next language to be introduced. Once a student is around 15, that is when the last years of their schooling is taught in French until they graduate. (I definetly think most American brains would break by the time they were 15 with having to switch between three different langauges, but that\u0026rsquo;s also because I\u0026rsquo;m jealous.) Although this is an amazing feat to be trilinigual at such an early age, there are not many colleges or universities in Luxembourg. After some slight googling, I found that the University of Luexmbourg is the only fully-fledged university, which was founded in 2003. This might explain why these students decide to leave Luxembourg and pursue their higher education in neighboring countries such as Belgium, France, or Germany, where they can not only speak the language, but it might be relatively cheaper.\nIndividual Contributions to Phase III # During this phase of the project, I completed the list of tables with whether or not that data would be sourced or generated. For the creation of the API routes, I went into google sheets and listed 10/11 routes that could be created within our app,and went through with the writing and implemetation of these routes into our api. On the Subleva page itself, I worked on creating the new pages and permissions for certain users which consisted of listing the oages and placing the valid information.\n","date":"5 June 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/gerber-test-hugo/ivyjordan/blogpost3/","section":"","summary":"Luxembourg and it\u0026rsquo;s Many Luxuries # On May 31st - June 3rd, we spent the weekend in Luxembourg, which was very similar and yet different from Belgium.","title":"Week 3: May 29th - June 5th ","type":"ivyjordan"},{"content":" Individual blog post 2 # I managed most of the data science aspects of this phase such as pulling the data from the API\u0026rsquo;s, using pandas to clean them, and investigating possible EDA\u0026rsquo;s to exemplify the main aspects of the datasets and visualize the potential answers to the major questions which inspired this project. I used pandas to download the json files and visualize them as dataframes from their 4 unique url\u0026rsquo;s. I then cleaned the data such as removing rows with empty information. Using these cleaned data, I investigated possible ideas to manipulate them for our project using tools such as .corr() to find values of correlation between different variables.\nUsing those EDA\u0026rsquo;s, I designed plots that I thought would be useful for interpreting solutions to our questions surrounding immigration and asylum seeking using the datasets and summary statistics, which can be found in the team post for phase 2. Finally, I graphed a regression model of the asylum applications sent to the United States globally per year, which will be used to make predictions about future asylum applications.\nSepartely to this, my time in Belgium has been nothing short of incredible. I have absolutely loved every minute of it. As a neuroscience major, I find it fascinating and am very aware of the rapid growth of mycomputer/data science skills in the recent weeks. This is the first time I have been thrust into such a rigorous environment where so much time is spent on the same subject. This method of learning has clearly been more efficient, rewarding, and valuable for my studies. I\u0026rsquo;m certainly glad to have had the opportunity to learn this about myself before I begin studying for the MCAT this coming fall.\nThis week we had many outings, my favorite of which was when we went to Brussels where we had the opportunity to visit microsoft Europe (followed by an interesting train ride home with the professors and a few of my classmates). Interacting with and learning from somebody whose background was in philosophy was a unique experience that changed my views on how certain my future is. Being able to have such an in depth conversation with such a succesful former philosophy undergraduate who now works in policy at such a large corporation undoubtedly expanding my idea of what my future may look like.

From a learning standpoint, class has really been accelerating quickly. Compared to my experience in Seattle, I had 8 weeks to learn object-oriented design and its special topics course, while here that has been cut to roughly 4 weeks. It\u0026rsquo;s interesting being able to compare my experience learning at different rates in which and learn the crucial aspects of database design needed to successfully complete the project. It\u0026rsquo;s also been really interesting being able to learn more about digital policy, which was an area of computer science and political science that I knew nothing about before switch my major, but being introduced to it makes me want to pursue further knowledge within certain areas of digital policy. On Monday, May 27th, we visited AMChamEU, which was the European branch of the American Commerce, which represented American businesses that have branches or dealings within the EU. After listening to Lucia talk about her experience with getting involved at AMCham, the important tasks she works on - with coordinating and meeting with bigger American companies and hosting these collaborative events-, makes me interested in pursuing my masters in a similar field of digital policy.\nEuropean Culture Shock # There has been a few moments of culture shock that has happened to me after being aborad for two weeks, some good and quite unique that has come to my attention:\nThe Good Things\nThe quality of life overall is beyond comparable to that in the United states that I\u0026rsquo;ve noticed. The air seems freshier - but this could also be because we are in a \u0026ldquo;small\u0026rdquo; town outside of Brussels. The towns are overall much cleanier with no excessive trash and rubbish on the street, and maintanece being maintained by workers who throughly do their job. The food is better, not just in terms of cusinines and restraunts available within a half mile, but the quality of the food is better as well. From fast food chains like KFC and McDonald\u0026rsquo;s to local bars and restraunts like Barvista and De Graffe, all have fresh ingredients with no additives and preservevatives. I feel healthier overall even though most of my diet consists of takeout and restaraunts.\nBrunch in Namur on May 18th, 2024 The Not-So-Good Things\nThere has only been a few things that I haven\u0026rsquo;t liked as much since being here in Belgium which may be traditional around Europe.\nPaying for water at bars and restaraunts!!! At first, I didn\u0026rsquo;t fully process that water was not free with meals. The fact that water is more expensive than beer at certain restraunts is absolutely crazy to me, but I guess that gives me an excuse to sample beers from the beer capital of Europe.\nNo AC: I am fully aware that air condition is not common within Europe, and if it is installed its typically installed by that tenat. However, coming back from long excurisons in the evening and my room being a sweatbox is not ideal.\nIndividual Contributions to Phase II # During this phase of the project, I primarily focused on creating the intial ER diagrams needs for the personas and then with Carson reevaulated and looked over the diagrams to see if anything needed to be added, changed, or deleted from the diagrams before fully fleshing these details out into the implementation of our project. Carson and I worked together to create the sql ddl tables for the Global Data Model.

We hope you all enjoy our documentation of this exciting process and journey during our Dialouge in Leuven, Belguim. Our team consists of three members:\nCarson Hunter Ivy Jordan Dylan Sacks Without further ado, here\u0026rsquo;s our project!\nOur Project Description # Migration is a natural byproduct of any human society and thus has remained and will continue to be a highly important topic for governments, politicians, and citizens alike. This often contentious topic can be very polarizing, and thus produces a wide range of emotions when discussed. Using more quantitative approaches to grasp this topic could help to reduce the contention and subjectivity behind migration. Recent years have specifically called to attention the incidence of refugee crises across the globe. As conflicts arise and citizens flee their countries, with often varying motivations, countries must now grapple with managing this influx of refugee populations. To do this, they must be given adequate time to prepare for, and thus react to changes in refugee populations or patterns. This project aims to create a software based tool to visualize and predict refugee and migration patterns. Using various datasets, our group hopes to both report on past immigration patterns and predict future trends using machine learning models. We hope that by providing an easy to use tool, we can allow important stakeholders to have a better understanding of the trends surrounding refugees and immigration. With this greater insight, our hope is that stakeholders will be able to use this quantifiable information to determine the best courses of action, ensuring the safety and wellbeing of both refugees and their populaces alike. This tool could additionally provide evidence based information to a very controversial topic, helping to create adequate justifications for the decisions that these shareholders choose to make.\nData Sources # http://data.un.org/Data.aspx?d=UNHCR\u0026f=indID%3aType-Ref - Table of refugees\nhttps://data.un.org/Data.aspx?d=POP\u0026f=tableCode:128\u0026c=2,3,6,8,10,12,14,16,17,18\u0026s=_countryEnglishNameOrderBy:asc,refYear:desc,areaCode:asc\u0026v=1 - Foreign population (non-citizens) 15 years of age or over by country of citizenship, educational attainment and sex\nhttps://www.unhcr.org/refugee-statistics/download/?url=g09Osq - refugee data finder\nhttps://data.un.org/Data.aspx?d=POP\u0026f=tableCode:405\u0026c=2,3,6,8,10,12,14,15,16\u0026s=_countryEnglishNameOrderBy:asc,refYear:desc,areaCode:asc\u0026v=1 - Number of incoming foreign migrants by country of citizenship and sex\nhttp://data.un.org/Data.aspx?d=POP\u0026f=tableCode%3a403 - Outflows by purpose of going abroad and sex\nhttps://api.unhcr.org/docs/refugee-statistics.html#api-Default-solutions - Refugee statistics API\nhttps://icr.ethz.ch/data/epr/er/ - Ethnicity of Refugees 2021 Database\nUser Persona and Stories # Immigration Focused Entities: Jackson Davies is a field officer with USCIS who has experience facing sudden surges in immigration applications, leading to delays and inefficient processing.\na) Davies will be able to allocate resources needed populations within a targeted area of the United states that faces more migration than others.\nb) Davies will be able to efficinetly manage immigration applications and anticipate where an influx of groups may arise from during a time of crisis based on historical context.\nc) Davies will be able to coordinate with other immigartion enities to be able to write policies and regulations on immigration based on the attributes and qualities of migration from certain countries.\nRelief Groups: Kyle Medina is a data scientist for the UNHCR based in Geneva, Switzerland, who is tasked with overseeing NGO / Red Cross locations which are facing a shortage of supplies in developing countries in the Southern Hemisphere.\na) He will be able to predict migration patterns to nearby asylum seeking countries, so they can account for the amount of necessary supplies needed for a duration of time.\nb) He will be able to know which regions that will be prone to an influx of refugees and know the amount of employees/volunteers needed per 1,000 refugees.\nc) He will be able to enhance the efficiency of distribution flow for certain products needed by a certain group of refugees such as women vs men, and children vs elderly groups.\nUrban Development Planners: Tanya Bracker is a city council member from Utica, New York, a city with a large refugee population, based on the last few years population increase, there will be budget cuts and allocations for more city resources.\na) She will be able to identify the common age demographic levels of refugees so she can know if primary and secondary schools budget allocations will be most effective.\nb) She will be able to anticipate and manage the housing needs for incoming refugees by predicting which regions are likely to send more refugees, thus preventing housing shortages.\nc) She will be able to plan for and improve public transportation routes and schedules to better serve areas with high refugee populations.\nMajor Questions # Question 1: Where are populations likely to move during major conflicts/crises? # This question is interesting and important to our project because it allows the critical process of immigration from countries in crisis to more stable ones to be more reliable/efficient. Answering this question would allow the stable countries that are likely to experience a sudden surge of migrants with nowhere else to go to be more prepared, allowing the process of immigration to be expedited, thus saving the lives of more immigrants.\nQuestion 2: How many refugees are moving (and are predicted to move) to a given country? # This question further prepares countries to be ready for immigrants, expanding from question 1. A general quantitative idea of how many people may need relocation would allow stable countries to work together to ensure that one country does not have too many refugees to handle. In other words, if the number of refugees trying to immigrate to country A is too great for country A to allow all of them, country A could communicate/agree with country B before they are overwhelmed with refugees, sending some of them there. Not only would this allow more refugees to be safely relocated, but it would likely improve the way people view migration due to the improvement in efficiency.\nQuestion 3: How can we optimize resource allocation and strategic planning for stakeholders based on predicted refugee and migration patterns? # This question is interesting because this data can help enhance the timeliness and effectiveness of humanitarian responses, ensuring that aid reaches those in need more quickly and efficiently during crises such as the situation arising in Gaza.\nAffirmation of data collection # From: https://icr.ethz.ch/data/epr/er/ - Ethnicity of Refugees 2021 Database # ","date":"21 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/gerber-test-hugo/team_posts/phase1post/","section":"Project - Phase I","summary":"Introduction # Hi, and welcome to our blog!","title":"Project - Phase I","type":"team_posts"},{"content":" Updates and Changes from Phase I # After our first initial round of feedback, we decided to implement a few changes from the original blogpost. The first change being the user stories to be properly formated:\nAs a ____, I want to ___ so that _____ .\nWe also received feedback that we should focus much more heavily on the software application portion of the project. Though we generated many different ideas for data analysis, it was important to incorporate features into our application that didn’t exclusively rely on data analysis. We decided to incorporate different uses into the application that were focused in the area of assisting migrant populations.\nUser Stories and Personas # Immigration Focused Entities: Jackson Davies is a senior official at his country’s immigration bureau who has experience facing sudden surges in immigration applications, leading to delays and inefficient processing.\na) \u0026ldquo;As an immigration official, I want to be able to predict the general population for the country so I can determine if there are adequate resources to accept asylum applications.\u0026rdquo;\nb) \u0026ldquo;As an immigration official, I want to be able to view past trends in asylum applications so I can determine if numbers of applications are likely to rise or fall.\u0026rdquo;\nc) \u0026ldquo;As an immigration official, accepting or denying an application for asylum can be very political. I also want to be able to view trends in asylum decisions so I can objectively show the state of immigration to the country.\u0026rdquo;\nRefugees: Hugo is a refugee from Guinea, who has recently been displaced and moved to a new European city with a large refugee population. It’s been a few months and he is concerned as to how he is supposed to support his family and doesn’t know what he needs to do in order to get certain resources.\na) \u0026ldquo;As a refugee, I want to schedule appointments with city service providers so that I can access necessary resources and support.\u0026rdquo;\nb) \u0026ldquo;As a refugee, I want to be able to post to a public bulletin that allows me to interact with other members of my community.\u0026rdquo;\nc) \u0026ldquo;As a refugee, I want to view upcoming community events so that I can participate and integrate into the community.\u0026rdquo;\nUrban Development Planners: Tanya Bracker is a city council member from Utica, New York, a city with a large refugee population, based on the last few years population increase, there will be budget cuts and allocations for more city resources.\na)\u0026ldquo;As an urban development planner, I want to organize community events to support the refugee population so that we can build better relationships between refugees and citizens of the city.\u0026rdquo;\nb)\u0026ldquo;As an urban development planner, I want to meet with refugee population representatives to address their needs and concerns so that we can better improve refugees’ quality of life during their time in my city.\u0026rdquo;\nc)\u0026ldquo;As an urban development planner, I want to analyze demographic data to enhance city infrastructure for refugees so that we can improve specific infrastructures most used and impacted by refugees.\u0026rdquo;\nData Visualizations # Asylum Applications to USA\nThis graph is depicting the change in immigration application requests from around the world sent to the United States over time. The size of the mark is proportional to the number of immigration applications sent, and the different countries are designated by varying colors. This graph indicates that the number of asylum applications has been increasing since 2010, the beginning of our dataset. This applies to our larger interest in predicting the number of refugees travelling to a specific country over time, directly applying this question to the United States. According to these data, the quantity of applications sent to the US per year has been booming since 2022, with huge outliers as well. Jackson Davies would be able to use this visualization to better manage immigration applications and anticipate where an influx of groups may arise.\nAge Demographics\nThis graph shows the age demographics of applicants seeking asylum per year. There is clearly an increase in the number of 18-59, and 5-11 year old males and females in the past 7 years. It is interesting that the second greatest increase in applications by age group appears to 5-11 year olds, as it would be expected to be either the age demographic immediately before 18-59 year olds. This graph could be used by someone such as Tanya Brakcer to understand and predict the age group demographic immigrating to new countries in order to effectively allocate school budgets.\nML Model POC\nThis linear regression model is comparing the asylum applications sent to the United States over time from all countries over time. The challenge surrounding this preliminary model was mainly that the x-values being years are a disctrete value while the y-value representing applications is continuous. Although this is not ideal for an ML model, it is sufficient as a proof of concept that can be ratified by implementing other variables such as applications from specific global areas, which would reveal more information and contribute to the overall question of predicting future asylumn applications. The next step for this model is to use it to predict future values of applications sent to the U.S. This model has a slope of 95.18, meaning that every year 95.18 more people apply for asylum than the previous year.\nGlobal Asylum Applications\nThis graph depicts the global asylum applications by year for every country of origin. The data are interesting as they indicate global conflicts, such as a large outlier of asylum applications coming from Ukraine to Russia in 2014. This graph could be used by someone such as Kyle Medina to predict which regions might experience an influx of asylum seekers to efficiently allocate resources such as aid. This can be used to answer the major question whihc sparked this project of \u0026ldquo;Where are populations likely to move during major conflicts/crises?\u0026rdquo;.\nLocalized ER Diagrams for User Archetypes # Government Immigration Focused Entities Refugee Entities Urban Development and Planning Entities Global ER Diagram SQL DDL for Global Data Model # SQL Query SQL Pop-Up Diagram\nDraft Wireframes of POC # Correlation Graph of Populations Seeking Asylum and Population Demographics # ","date":"21 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/gerber-test-hugo/team_posts/phase2post/","section":"Project - Phase I","summary":"Updates and Changes from Phase I # After our first initial round of feedback, we decided to implement a few changes from the original blogpost.","title":"Project - Phase II","type":"team_posts"},{"content":" Carson Hunter # Hi, My name is Carson Hunter, and I love statistics and data science!\n","date":"17 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/gerber-test-hugo/carsonhunter/","section":"","summary":"Carson Hunter # Hi, My name is Carson Hunter, and I love statistics and data science!","title":"","type":"carsonhunter"},{"content":" A New Continent - Initial Thoughts on My First Time in Europe # Hey Blog!\n​\tIt’s officially been a week of the Dialogue of Civilizations in Belgium, and it has truly been one of my most fond experiences in recent memory. It’s genuinely so interesting and exciting to interact with another culture and see the differences in the intricacies in how we live. We’ve also had so many amazing opportunities to visit some of the world’s most powerful institutions and attend talks with people who are truly shaping the globe. With that in mind, I\u0026rsquo;d like to walk you through some highlights of this trip so far.\nGetting Here # After the longest flight I\u0026rsquo;ve ever taken, I touched down in Dublin, Ireland. As I\u0026rsquo;m staying at the Irish College, it was a cool coincidence that I happened to transit through the country on my way to Belgium. I felt my stomach turn as the plane lurched forward to make the last 2 hour flight of my trip to Brussels. I had so many preconceived notions about what Belgium would be like, and I couldn\u0026rsquo;t have been more wrong.\nWhen we arrived in Leuven, I was amazed at the city\u0026rsquo;s architecture. I joked with the people around me that everything looked like it was a facade, like on Main Street USA at Magic Kingdom. Everywhere you look, there\u0026rsquo;s some building with centuries of history. We finished a walking tour of Leuven, and I was thrilled to explore this new city.\nNATO # I\u0026rsquo;ll admit, I was not enthusiastic to wake up at 6:00am to go to NATO. In fact, when my alarm clock rang, there were many other things I would have preferred to do at that moment. Thankfully, I stuck it out, and got to have such an awesome experience at the headquarters of an extremely powerful organization. It was truly such a privileged experience to be able to have talks with such bright people.\nBruges # On our free day, much of the group decided to take a 1.5 hour train to Bruges. What a beautiful place. It\u0026rsquo;s touristy, but for good reason. From the rivers winding through the city, to the massive bell tower, this city blew me away. It was the perfect temperature, the birds were chirping, and I was eating a waffle debating how it gets better than this. We took another 10 minute train to a town on the coast, a resort city called Blankenberge. The contrast between the medieval looking city just 15 km away was mind-boggling. There were a handful of palm trees, a thousand foot wide beach, and a tiki bar. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t believe I was in the same country. Eventually, we came back to Leuven, walked through the (extremely bright) evening, and I took a moment to appreciate the fact that I\u0026rsquo;m here.\nAll that to say I am truly so grateful to be a part of this program and I\u0026rsquo;m already dreading the day I\u0026rsquo;ll have to pack up my bags in Leuven. Belgium has exceeded my expectations in almost every way. I can\u0026rsquo;t wait to come back.\n","date":"17 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/gerber-test-hugo/carsonhunter/post1/","section":"","summary":"A New Continent - Initial Thoughts on My First Time in Europe # Hey Blog!","title":"Blog Post #1","type":"carsonhunter"},{"content":"Hi Blog!\nWe’re officially halfway through the dialogue and I’m more than sad to say that there’s less time in Belgium in front of me than there is behind. It’s been such a fun experience and every day brings a new and exciting adventure.\nWith that being said, it\u0026rsquo;s been a busy 2 weeks. We’ve had a variety of experiences, from day trips to other cities, more talks with powerful people, and even pastry workshops!\nIt’s been a great time, and I keep reiterating how Belgium continues to exceed my expectations. Though I’m sad the end of the trip is approaching, I’m excited to keep having more of these fun experiences!\nProject Contributions\nIn this phase of the project, I worked on altering the user stories to match the scope of the project more. Specifically, Ivy and I worked on brainstorming ideas for integrating a more software-based approach instead of purely data science. After generating accurate user stories, Ivy and I collaboratively authored our ER diagrams to depict the relationships. While Ivy dealt more with the local diagrams, we both worked on merging them into one cohesive global diagram. I also handled the participation and cardinality for the relationships. I worked with Ivy to complete SQL DDL as we worked through our global ER diagram. Ivy typed the code while I interpreted the ER diagram. I then worked on the wireframe that Ivy originally created, especially focusing on the refugee portion.\n","date":"17 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/gerber-test-hugo/carsonhunter/post2/","section":"","summary":"Hi Blog!","title":"Blog Post #2","type":"carsonhunter"},{"content":"Hey Blog!\nI can\u0026rsquo;t believe we\u0026rsquo;re almost done with the dialouge. I\u0026rsquo;ve had such a fun time in Belguim and every day I\u0026rsquo;m consistently surprised by how much I\u0026rsquo;ve enjoyed this trip. I will admit, however, there are some creature comforts of home I\u0026rsquo;m starting to miss.\n#1 AIR CONDITIONING! I am a person who loves to be cold when I\u0026rsquo;m indoors, and the lack of air conditioning (or ventalation in general) is a real point of contention for me.\n#2 ICE! I am going to begin to refer to Europe as the continent of room temperature everything. I cannot wait to drink gallons and gallons of ice water when I get back to the States.\n#3 WATER!!!!! Extending from my second point, I feel that I\u0026rsquo;m in a constant state of dehydration here. I miss the abundance of drinking fountains in the state, and the large cups and bottles that I can fill with said fountains. I also miss not paying for water. Sometimes water at restaurants costs more than beer(?!)\nThat being said, I love so much about this place, but home will always be home! I just wish America adopted the \u0026ldquo;tax included\u0026rdquo; standard that exists in Europe. It makes things so much simpler.\nProject Contributions\nThis phase of the project caused many hurdles. Though msot of the major kinks seemed to be ironed out, it definitely required lots of work to get there. In this phase of the project specifically, I worked heavily on writing and calling the api routes that Ivy outlined in the matrix. I worked with Ivy to help set out formatting and initial structure for the front end pages. I also helped Dylan get the machine learning model running.\n","date":"17 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/gerber-test-hugo/carsonhunter/post3/","section":"","summary":"Hey Blog!","title":"Blog Post #3","type":"carsonhunter"},{"content":" Individual blog post 1 # Although I have thoroughly enjoyed just about every activity we’ve done on the dialogue, the one that stands out the most was the first visit we had to the EEAS in Brussels. During this visit, we had several talented guest speakers discuss what the EEAS is and their personal role in its proper function. During this we discussed the concept of disinformation/misinformation. This has been the most intriguing thing I’ve learned since arriving a week ago because of how prominent it was discussed to be. Although I have certainly heard about fake news being discussed in the realm of politics, as well as deep fakes made by AI, my understanding of the severity of the issue was astonishingly inaccurate. Several of the key points the third speaker emphasized were concepts that I hadn’t even fathomed. It is clearly quite a large and present issue that democratic societies are more vulnerable to the misinformation produced by non-democratic states, due to their lack of information filtration in comparison with states such as Russia or China. One of the statistics he mentioned was that there have been 16,000 known cases of pro-kremlin disinformation catalogued since 2015. We were also taught the distinction between disinformation and misinformation to be dependent on the intentions, where disinformation is objectively false or misleading information spread with the intent of causing harm, whereas the negative impact from misinformation occurs by accident. The message that I personally took away from this speaker was that information integrity and manipulation is an incredibly harmful act that even though in some cases may not be illegal, it is almost a proxy war. To conclude, I was absolutely blown away by the necessary amount of time and effort that goes into fighting this spread of false information, as well as how impactful it can be. I think this is such an important topic that people need to be further educated on in order to be critical thinkers and make better decisions.\n","date":"17 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/gerber-test-hugo/dylansacks/phase1individualpost/","section":"","summary":"Individual blog post 1 # Although I have thoroughly enjoyed just about every activity we’ve done on the dialogue, the one that stands out the most was the first visit we had to the EEAS in Brussels.","title":"Individual Blog Post 1","type":"dylansacks"},{"content":" Brussel\u0026rsquo;s International Presence # One thing that I\u0026rsquo;ve found interesting so far being in Belgium, in general is just the sheer amount of international agencies are based here. On first glance or intial thought I would always imagine these large entinties like NATO, UNICEF, EEAS, etc would be located in France, Netherlands, or even Germany.\nHowever learning more about the reasoning behind the location, makes sense in terms of the geographical location. It was central to some of the founding organizations for NATO that were already located in Europe such as West Germany, France, Luxembourg, Belgium, and Netherlands. This as well as during the President Charles de Gaulle withdrew France from NATO because of the organization’s domination by the United States and the \u0026ldquo;intrusion\u0026rdquo; upon French sovereignty.\nWith Belgium being home to so many international bodies, and having contact with representatives from over 45 countries, it also adds to the multitude of languages being spoken not ony in the capital of Brussels, but even here in Leuven.\nVisting NATO headquarters on May 17th, 2024 Leuven\u0026rsquo;s Languages # Leuven has a large international presence, with a student body comprising from over 100 countries. This diversity is reflected in the wide variety of languages spoken around Leuven. From the Belgian common languages such as Flemish Dutch and French, I\u0026rsquo;ve even heard students speaking Russian, Irish, and even Arabic. With Leuven being an international hub for foreign policy, it makes sense that a large international student population would follow as well, which enrichens the educational experience in Leuven, and henceforth Brussels.\nDatabase Design in Leuven # As the first week of classes concludes here in Leuven and we begin to learn more about the fundamentals of database design. Its intereting to learn more about the ways to properly call upon data using SQL. I was vaguely familar with the language from my time taking Principles of Information Science and being able to analyze adatsets to pull direct information, but the caliber of information being pulled required at most a single standard select statement and being able to pull elementary data from them. In the rough two days that we\u0026rsquo;ve had full session classes, I\u0026rsquo;ve managed to utilize more of SQL than before with being able to pull more niche or nested data b using a series of more complex operations in SQL such as NATURAL JOINS, ORDER BY, ASIDES, and UNIONS.\nI\u0026rsquo;m defintely excited about being able to use sql to form a type of a data-driven app focusing on the areas of international politics and government, and seeing what real world scenarios and issues that could be possibly solved through the usage of data.\n","date":"17 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/gerber-test-hugo/ivyjordan/blogpost1/","section":"","summary":"Brussel\u0026rsquo;s International Presence # One thing that I\u0026rsquo;ve found interesting so far being in Belgium, in general is just the sheer amount of international agencies are based here.","title":"Week 1: May 13th - May 20th","type":"ivyjordan"},{"content":"","date":"11 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/gerber-test-hugo/authors/eric_gerber/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Eric_gerber","type":"authors"},{"content":" Welcome to Subleva! # Welcome to the Subleva Team\u0026rsquo;s Blog, a blog post that consists of updates during the various project phases.\n","date":"11 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/gerber-test-hugo/team_posts/","section":"Project - Phase I","summary":"Welcome to Subleva!","title":"Project - Phase I","type":"team_posts"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/gerber-test-hugo/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/gerber-test-hugo/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"}]
